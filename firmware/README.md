This is the source code for the firmware to be loaded on the ATtiny85. A
Makefile is provided that assumes you have the *gcc-avr* compiler suite
installed. It has only been tested on Ubuntu but should work on any modern
Linux system. Windows and OS/X support is left as an exercise
for the reader.

The firmware is around 1.5K of compiled code and the Makefile could be easily
modified for use on the ATtiny45 as an alternative.
