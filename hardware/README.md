Schematic and PCB layout in [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) format as well
as the [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) files needed to generate the 3D
models for the printable casing.

The models will have to be modified to suit the size of the components you are
using. Most of the definitions are in the *common.scad* file so you can adjust
the parameters there.
