This directory contains some support utilities for the device. It includes a
Python library (nightlight.py) that can be used to communicate with the device
and modify the settings.

The two main tools are *monitor.py* that will simply dump the state variables
in CSV format - the resulting data can be pulled into a spreadsheet for
analysis. The other tools is *nlconfig.py* which provides a graphical UI for
configuring the device.
